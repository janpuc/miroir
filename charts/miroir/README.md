Replicated block storage for small Kubernetes clusters — CSI on LVM thin, ZFS, or loopfile backends with synchronous DRBD9 replication

**Homepage:** <https://github.com/home-operations/miroir>

## Usage

Replicated block storage for small Kubernetes clusters. Control plane in
Go; data path delegated to in-kernel primitives (dm-thin, ZFS, or loop
devices, with synchronous DRBD9 replication). Full documentation at
<https://miroir.home-operations.com/>.

```sh
helm install miroir oci://ghcr.io/home-operations/charts/miroir \
  --namespace miroir-system --create-namespace -f values.yaml
```

## Upgrading

Helm applies the chart's `crds/` directory only on install, never on
upgrade, and a stale CRD schema silently prunes newer spec fields. Keep
the CRDs in step with the chart on every upgrade — Flux users must set
`upgrade.crds: CreateReplace` on the HelmRelease (the default is Skip);
plain Helm users apply them by hand first:

```sh
helm show crds oci://ghcr.io/home-operations/charts/miroir \
  --version <new-version> | kubectl apply --server-side -f -
```

Version-specific steps live in the
[upgrade guide](https://miroir.home-operations.com/upgrading/).

## Storage configuration

This chart installs only the driver. The node topology
(MiroirNode/MiroirNodeGroup custom resources), StorageClasses, and
VolumeSnapshotClasses are plain manifests — see the
[quickstart](https://miroir.home-operations.com/quickstart/) for the
layouts.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| agent.extraArgs | list | `[]` | Extra arguments for the agent container. |
| agent.extraEnv | list | `[]` | Extra environment variables for the agent container. |
| agent.image.digest | string | `""` |  |
| agent.image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` |  |
| agent.image.repository | string | `"ghcr.io/home-operations/miroir-agent"` |  |
| agent.image.tag | string | `""` |  |
| agent.kubeletDir | string | `"/var/lib/kubelet"` | Kubelet root on the nodes; CSI sockets and mounts hang off it. |
| agent.loopfileBaseDirs | list | `[]` | Loopfile base directories to hostPath-mount into the agent (identity-mounted: host path == container path). Must list every `loopfile.baseDir` your MiroirNode specs use — the topology lives in CRs the chart cannot read at render time, but the mounts are pod spec. Harmless on nodes without a loopfile pool. |
| agent.peerFence | bool | `false` | Let a healthy node drop the replication link to a peer whose storage stack has wedged, by leaving it out of the rendered DRBD config. A wedged node's kernel holds every resource it had open read-only, and DRBD then refuses promotion on the healthy peers, so clean survivors cannot serve a volume the dead node is sitting on. Off by default: it changes DRBD membership from live peer state, and that wants validating against a real wedged node before it runs unattended. `autoEvict` reaches the same outcome through the spec, with all the placement gates, a few minutes later. |
| agent.podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Extra annotations on the agent pods. |
| agent.podLabels | object | `{}` | Extra labels on the agent pods. |
| agent.poolStatsInterval | string | `"60s"` |  |
| agent.registrar.image | string | `"registry.k8s.io/sig-storage/csi-node-driver-registrar:v2.17.0"` |  |
| agent.registrar.resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"64Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"5m","memory":"16Mi"}}` | Registrar sidecar resources. |
| agent.resources.limits.memory | string | `"128Mi"` |  |
| agent.resources.requests.cpu | string | `"10m"` |  |
| agent.resources.requests.memory | string | `"32Mi"` |  |
| agent.volumeWorkers | int | `4` | Concurrent volume reconciles per agent. Per-volume work is serialized by controller-runtime regardless; this bounds how many distinct volumes one agent works at once. |
| agent.wedgeTaint | bool | `true` | Taint a node `miroir.home-operations.com/storage-wedged=true:NoSchedule` while its storage stack is wedged. A wedged node keeps a Ready kubelet, so without this the scheduler keeps sending it pods it cannot mount. The agent removes the taint once a reboot clears the kernel state. Turn off when another controller owns node remediation and miroir should not write to Node objects; doing so also drops `patch` on `nodes` from the agent's RBAC. |
| autoDiskfulAfter | string | `""` | Convert a diskless leg (client or tie-breaker) that has stayed DRBD Primary past this duration into a local diskful replica on its node, so a settled consumer stops paying network I/O (LINSTOR's auto-diskful; Go duration, e.g. "10m"). Conversion needs a MiroirNode for the leg's node with fresh pool stats and room for the volume's full size. Empty disables it. See the root README, "Auto-diskful". |
| autoEvictAfter | string | `""` | Re-place a dead storage node's legs once its heartbeat (MiroirNode status, refreshed ~60s) has been stale this long (LINSTOR's auto-evict; Go duration, e.g. "60m" — keep it well above any reboot or upgrade window). Each affected volume gets one atomic swap: the dead entry out, a fresh replica in (full sync follows). The dead node keeps its teardown finalizer as the record of its never-cleaned leg: deleting an evicted volume still waits for that node, and when the node returns its agent tears the leftover leg down through the normal removal flow. It never acts when more than one node looks dead, when a survivor still sees the node's DRBD links up, when the remaining legs are not clean, or when snapshots pin the volume. Needs a spare storage node carrying the volume's pool; per-node opt-out via `spec.autoEvict: false` on its MiroirNode. Empty disables it (the default: eviction discards the dead node's data). |
| autoTieBreaker | bool | `true` | Add a diskless tie-breaker replica to 2-replica freeze volumes when a spare storage node exists, so majority quorum survives a single node loss. Also retrofits existing freeze volumes at controller startup. |
| drbd.alExtents | string | `""` | al-extents, the DRBD activity-log size (number of 4 MiB extents kept "hot"). DRBD's default (1237) forces frequent metadata updates under a scattered random-write workload; raising it (e.g. 6007) cuts that write amplification at the cost of a longer resync of the active region after a crash. Empty leaves DRBD's default. Must be a prime below 65534. |
| drbd.diskTimeout | int | `0` | disk-timeout in 0.1s units: how long DRBD waits for a backing-device I/O before force-detaching, e.g. 600 (60s). At the DRBD default of 0 (infinite) a failing backing disk can wedge a reboot in drbd_md_sync_page_io; but DRBD's manual warns that aborting a request whose completion later arrives can corrupt reused pages or panic the kernel, which is why upstream ships it disabled. Opt in deliberately on hardware known to hang instead of erroring. |
| drbd.extraConfig.disk | string | `""` | Extra lines for the disk {} section (e.g. "read-balancing least-pending;"). |
| drbd.extraConfig.handlers | string | `""` | Extra lines for the handlers {} section (e.g. fence handlers). |
| drbd.extraConfig.net | string | `""` | Extra lines for the net {} section (e.g. "csums-alg crc32c;"). |
| drbd.extraConfig.options | string | `""` | Extra lines for the options {} section (resource options). |
| drbd.extraConfig.startup | string | `""` | Extra lines for the startup {} section. |
| drbd.net.maxBuffers | string | `""` | max-buffers, the DRBD receive-buffer count (e.g. "36864"); raises resync throughput on fast links. |
| drbd.onIoError | string | `"detach"` |  |
| drbd.portBase | int | `7000` | Lowest TCP port for DRBD replication links, one per replicated volume ascending (7000, 7001, …). The agent runs hostNetwork so these bind on the node's kernel. Ceph mgr dashboard's non-SSL default is also 7000; co-locating with Rook host-network Ceph requires moving one of them (see issue #148). Existing volumes keep their assigned ports. |
| drbd.resync.discardGranularity | string | `""` | rs-discard-granularity cluster-wide fallback: during a full resync, runs of zeroes are sent as discards of this size instead of written out (e.g. "65536"), keeping a re-added thin leg thin. Normally leave empty — the agent probes each lvmthin/zfs backing device and renders an exact per-leg value that overrides this (loopfile is never probed: loop devices mishandle it, so also leave this empty on clusters with loopfile-backed replicated volumes). |
| drbd.resync.fillTarget | string | `""` | c-fill-target, the resync controller's target fill level (e.g. "1M"). |
| drbd.resync.maxRate | string | `""` | c-max-rate, the resync bandwidth ceiling used when the link is idle (e.g. "720M"). |
| drbd.resync.minRate | string | `"10M"` | c-min-rate, the resync floor guaranteed even under application I/O. Defaulted to 10M: DRBD's kernel default (250 KiB/s) leaves a degraded volume resyncing for days under load; 10 MiB/s heals a 100Gi leg in hours while still yielding most of a 1GbE link to applications. Lower on a slow shared link. |
| drbd.resync.planAhead | string | `""` | c-plan-ahead in 0.1s units; a value > 0 enables DRBD's variable-rate resync controller. |
| drbd.resync.rate | string | `""` | resync-rate, the fixed rate used only when the controller is off (planAhead empty or 0). |
| drbd.verify.algorithm | string | `"crc32c"` | verify-alg, arming `drbdadm verify <res>` — the only cross-leg integrity check (a zfs scrub only validates one leg against itself). Defaulted to crc32c: drbd.ko depends on libcrc32c so it is present on every node, and it costs nothing until a verify runs. Empty disables verification, including the schedule below. |
| drbd.verify.schedule | string | `""` | Cron spec (5-field, agent-local/UTC time) for a scheduled online verify of every replicated volume. The agent initiates it once per volume from the coordinator (first diskful replica), serialized per node, skipping volumes that are resyncing or already verifying. Findings land in the volume's status (`lastVerifyOutOfSyncBytes`), the `miroir_volume_verify_*` metrics, and a `VerifyOutOfSync` event. Empty = no scheduled verify (run it by hand). Requires `algorithm` set. |
| drbd.verify.suspend | bool | `false` | Pause scheduled verify without dropping the schedule above. |
| extraArgs | list | `[]` | Extra arguments for the controller container. |
| extraEnv | list | `[]` | Extra environment variables for the controller container. |
| freeSpaceRatio | int | `20` | Physical-space guardrail: CreateVolume is refused when the request would exceed the pool's *free* bytes × this ratio. overcommitRatio alone bounds virtual bytes, so a pool whose thin volumes have actually filled it can still admit more; running a pool out of space surfaces as I/O errors under live volumes rather than a clean refusal. 20× matches LINSTOR and BlockStor and only bites once a pool is ~90% full; lower it toward 1 to keep more physical headroom in reserve. |
| fullnameOverride | string | `""` | Override the fully qualified name prefix of every rendered object. |
| gateway.enabled | bool | `false` | Serve ReadWriteMany (and ReadOnlyMany) PVCs via per-volume NFS gateways. Opt-in: gateway pods run privileged in the release namespace, and any user who can create a PVC can cause one to be spawned, so enabling RWX is an explicit operator decision. While disabled the controller rejects RWX at provision time with a clear message, and the gateway ServiceAccount, RBAC, PodMonitor, and export alerts are not installed. |
| gateway.image.digest | string | `""` |  |
| gateway.image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` |  |
| gateway.image.repository | string | `"ghcr.io/home-operations/miroir-gateway"` |  |
| gateway.image.tag | string | `""` |  |
| global.affinity | object | `{}` |  |
| global.commonLabels | object | `{}` | Labels stamped on every rendered object (fleet-wide labelling). |
| global.imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | Pull secrets added to every pod (controller, agent, uninstall). |
| global.nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Controller scheduling defaults. |
| global.tolerations | list | `[]` |  |
| groupSnapshots.enabled | bool | `false` |  |
| image | object | `{"digest":"","pullPolicy":"IfNotPresent","repository":"ghcr.io/home-operations/miroir-controller","tag":""}` | Controller image (distroless, no storage userland — the controller never execs a storage CLI). |
| leaderElection.enabled | bool | `false` | Elect even with a single replica (replicaCount > 1 elects regardless; this can never switch election off above one replica). |
| leaderElection.id | string | `""` | Lease name; empty derives the release-scoped controller name so two releases in one namespace never share a Lease. Keep it stable across upgrades. |
| logging.format | string | `"json"` | Encoder: json (structured, default) or console (human-readable). |
| logging.level | string | `"info"` | Log level: debug | info | error (or any zapcore level). |
| monitoring.dashboards.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations added to the dashboard ConfigMap. |
| monitoring.dashboards.enabled | bool | `false` | Render the Grafana dashboard ConfigMap (for grafana-operator or the kube-prometheus-stack sidecar). |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.allowCrossNamespaceImport | bool | `true` | If true allows for a Grafana in any namespace to access this GrafanaDashboard. |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.enabled | bool | `false` | Render a GrafanaDashboard CR (grafana-operator) instead of a sidecar ConfigMap. |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.folder | string | `""` | Folder to create the dashboard in. |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.matchLabels | object | `{}` | Selected labels for Grafana instance. |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.resyncPeriod | string | `"10m"` | Resync period for the Grafana operator to check for updates to the dashboard. |
| monitoring.dashboards.labels | object | `{}` | Labels added to the dashboard ConfigMap. |
| monitoring.dashboards.namespace | string | `""` | Namespace for the dashboard objects; defaults to the release namespace. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.annotations | object | `{}` | PodMonitor annotations. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.enabled | bool | `false` | Create a Prometheus Operator PodMonitor (requires its CRDs) scraping the controller and every agent pod on their metrics ports. The per-volume miroir_volume_* gauges are exported by the agents. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.interval | string | `"30s"` | Scrape interval. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.labels | object | `{}` | PodMonitor labels. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.metricRelabelings | list | `[]` | Prometheus metric relabelings. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.path | string | `"/metrics"` | Metrics path. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.podTargetLabels | list | `[]` | Pod target labels to copy from pods. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.relabelings | list | `[]` | Extra Prometheus relabelings (applied before scraping); a node label from the pod's node name is always added. |
| monitoring.podMonitor.scrapeTimeout | string | `"10s"` | Scrape timeout. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.additionalRuleAnnotations | object | `{}` | Extra annotations added to every alert rule. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.additionalRuleLabels | object | `{}` | Extra labels added to every alert rule. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.annotations | object | `{}` | PrometheusRule annotations. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.enabled | bool | `false` | Create a PrometheusRule with alerting rules (requires the Prometheus Operator CRDs). |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.labels | object | `{}` | PrometheusRule labels. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.overrides | object | `{}` | Per-alert overrides keyed by alert name. Per entry: `disabled: true` drops the rule, `for` replaces the rule's wait period, and `labels` merge over the rule's own (set `severity` here to reclassify one alert). Example:   overrides:     MiroirVolumeOutOfSync: { disabled: true }     MiroirVolumeDisconnected:       for: 30m       labels: { severity: info } |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.verifyStaleDays | int | `8` | Days since the last completed scheduled verify before MiroirVolumeVerifyStale fires. Size it to just over the schedule period (a weekly `drbd.verify.schedule` → 8). The rule is only rendered when `drbd.verify.schedule` is set. |
| nameOverride | string | `""` | Override the chart name used in labels and default object names. |
| orphanVolumeAfter | string | `"1h"` | Condition a MiroirVolume `Orphaned` once it has existed this long with no PersistentVolume of its name (Go duration). An orphan still holds thin-pool space, a DRBD minor, a replication port and a full set of `miroir_volume_*` series — including the per-volume wedge gauge, which then alerts on a volume nobody owns. The grace period covers the provisioning race: CreateVolume creates the MiroirVolume and the external provisioner creates the PV afterwards. Empty disables the sweep. |
| orphanVolumeReapAfter | string | `""` | Delete a volume once `Orphaned` has held this long (Go duration). Never while a client leg is attached, a leg is DRBD Primary, or a snapshot still references it. Empty (the default) leaves the condition standing for an operator: a wrong condition costs a line in `kubectl describe`, a wrong delete costs a backing device. Set it once the condition has been seen to name only volumes you would have deleted by hand anyway. |
| overcommitRatio | int | `2` | Thin-provisioning overcommit guardrail: CreateVolume is refused when a node's provisioned total would exceed capacity × this ratio. 2× is the classic CoW headroom; raise it only if you trust your usage to stay sparse, lower it toward 1 to provision conservatively. |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Extra annotations on the controller pod. |
| podLabels | object | `{}` | Extra labels on the controller pod. |
| priorityClassName | string | `"system-cluster-critical"` | system-cluster-critical protects the single controller from eviction under node pressure — while it is down, no volume can be provisioned, expanded, or snapshotted. |
| provisionTimeout | string | `"120s"` | Wait for agents to realise a new volume. Keep sidecars.*.timeout at or above this, or the sidecar RPC deadline fires before this one and the knob has no effect. |
| replicaCount | int | `1` | Controller replicas. Anything above 1 automatically enables leader election: the extras are warm standbys (failover is lease expiry, ~15s, instead of a full pod reschedule), the rollout strategy switches to RollingUpdate, and a PodDisruptionBudget keeps one replica through voluntary disruptions. Pointless on a single-node cluster (the node is the failure domain); pair with global.affinity (pod anti-affinity) so replicas land on different nodes. |
| resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"10m","memory":"32Mi"}}` | Controller resources. |
| sidecars.healthMonitor.enabled | bool | `false` |  |
| sidecars.healthMonitor.image | string | `"registry.k8s.io/sig-storage/csi-external-health-monitor-controller:v0.18.0"` |  |
| sidecars.healthMonitor.interval | string | `"1m"` |  |
| sidecars.healthMonitor.resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"10m","memory":"32Mi"}}` | Health-monitor sidecar resources. |
| sidecars.provisioner.image | string | `"registry.k8s.io/sig-storage/csi-provisioner:v6.3.0"` |  |
| sidecars.provisioner.resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"10m","memory":"32Mi"}}` | Provisioner sidecar resources. |
| sidecars.provisioner.timeout | string | `"120s"` |  |
| sidecars.resizer.image | string | `"registry.k8s.io/sig-storage/csi-resizer:v2.2.1"` |  |
| sidecars.resizer.resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"10m","memory":"32Mi"}}` | Resizer sidecar resources. |
| sidecars.resizer.timeout | string | `"120s"` |  |
| sidecars.snapshotter.image | string | `"registry.k8s.io/sig-storage/csi-snapshotter:v8.6.0"` |  |
| sidecars.snapshotter.resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"10m","memory":"32Mi"}}` | Snapshotter sidecar resources. |
| sidecars.snapshotter.timeout | string | `"120s"` |  |
| storageCapacity.enabled | bool | `false` |  |
| uninstall.confirmation | string | `""` | Consent to destroy all volume data on `helm uninstall`: set to the literal "yes-really-destroy-data" to render the pre-delete hook Job that deletes every MiroirSnapshot and MiroirVolume — the agents then tear down each DRBD resource and backing device, including volumes whose PV reclaimPolicy is Retain. Hooks are baked into the release at install/upgrade time, so set this with a `helm upgrade` *before* running `helm uninstall`. Any other non-empty value fails the render. |
| uninstall.image | string | `"registry.k8s.io/kubectl:v1.36.3"` | Image for the uninstall hook Job (needs only `kubectl`). |
| unreachableNodeTolerationSeconds | int | `5` | Seconds the controller pod stays bound to an unreachable node before eviction. The Kubernetes default (300) leaves a single-replica controller unable to provision, expand, or snapshot for five minutes after its node dies; 5 reschedules it almost immediately (the controller is stateless). |
