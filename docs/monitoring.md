# Monitoring

Volume health in miroir is reported per node. Each agent exports
what its own leg of every volume sees, so a problem shows up as a
metric on the node that has it. The controller adds the few
cluster-level signals the agents can't know, like RWX gateway
health.

`monitoring.podMonitor.enabled: true` creates a Prometheus Operator
PodMonitor scraping the controller **and every agent** on their
`metrics` ports (the per-volume gauges are exported by the agent on
each storage node; a `node` label is added to every series). The
diskful per-volume gauges also carry a `pool` label naming the pool
backing that node's leg. Pools are per-node, so two legs of one
volume can report different pools, which lets you scope volume
health to a pool (the shipped dashboard's `pool` variable does
exactly that). `miroir_volume_diskless_primary` and
`miroir_volume_wedged` are the exceptions: a diskless leg holds no
backing device in any pool, and a wedged teardown's pool can be
unknowable, so both carry no pool label.

Every volume series also carries `pvc` and `pvc_namespace`: the
PersistentVolumeClaim the volume serves, so dashboards and alerts
read the claim's name instead of the opaque `pvc-<uuid>` volume
name (which stays available as the `volume` label). The pair is
recorded on the `MiroirVolume` at provisioning time and backfilled
onto pre-existing volumes from their PV; a volume whose claim is
unknown falls back to its volume name in `pvc`, with an empty
`pvc_namespace`. The agent exports, per volume on that node:

| Metric                                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `miroir_volume_up_to_date`                    | 1 when this node's replica is UpToDate (unreplicated volumes are always 1 once created)                                                   |
| `miroir_volume_connected`                     | 1 when all replication links to diskful peers are established (tie-breaker links excluded)                                                |
| `miroir_volume_split_brain`                   | 1 when DRBD refused to reconnect after divergence; manual resolution required                                                             |
| `miroir_volume_suspended`                     | 1 while the snapshot write barrier freezes IO; sustained means a stranded barrier                                                         |
| `miroir_volume_resync_ratio`                  | fraction (0-1) in sync of the least-synced diskful peer; 1 when fully in sync                                                             |
| `miroir_volume_quorum`                        | 0 while a `freeze` volume has lost quorum and refuses writes, the "workloads are failing I/O" signal (always 1 under `last-man-standing`) |
| `miroir_volume_disk_failed`                   | 1 when this leg's disk was detached after an I/O error and latched failed; replace the disk, then remove and re-add the replica           |
| `miroir_volume_out_of_sync_bytes`             | worst per-peer out-of-sync bytes: the exposure if the healthiest peer is lost; also counts online-verify findings                         |
| `miroir_volume_primary`                       | 1 while this node's diskful leg is Primary: the consumer pod or the RWX gateway runs here and this leg serves the I/O                     |
| `miroir_volume_diskless_primary`              | 1 while a diskless leg (client or tie-breaker) is Primary here: the consumer pays network I/O; see auto-diskful                           |
| `miroir_volume_verify_last_timestamp_seconds` | unix time of the last completed scheduled verify; alert on staleness to catch a schedule that stopped firing                              |
| `miroir_volume_verify_out_of_sync_bytes`      | out-of-sync bytes the last scheduled verify found (0 = clean)                                                                             |
| `miroir_volume_wedged`                        | 1 when the kernel can no longer tear down this volume's DRBD resource (LINBIT/drbd#137); only a node reboot clears it                     |

Each agent additionally exports its pool capacities
(`miroir_pool_capacity_bytes` / `miroir_pool_allocated_bytes` /
`miroir_pool_meta_used_ratio`, one series per named pool via the
`pool` label), the same sample that feeds capacity-aware placement
and the `PoolUsageHigh` condition. Pool exhaustion is alertable,
and two pools on one node stay distinguishable, not just an Event.
It also exports `miroir_node_drbd_kernel_info` (always 1): the DRBD
kernel module version probed at startup (`version` label) plus the
agent image's drbd-utils version (`utils_version` label), from
client-only nodes too (which have no `MiroirNode` status). Query it
for fleet version skew before a release raises the kernel floor.

Four further node-scoped series cover the failure mode that
`miroir_volume_wedged` only ever sees one volume of at a time:

| Metric                              | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `miroir_node_stranded_children`     | host commands killed at their deadline whose task is still in uninterruptible sleep, so the kernel will neither run nor reap them |
| `miroir_node_wedged`                | 1 while the node-scoped breaker is open: miroir has stopped spawning storage commands because each new one only strands too       |
| `miroir_node_drbd_assertions_total` | fatal DRBD kernel assertions (`put_ldev` refcount underflows, LINBIT/drbd#137) sighted in the kernel log since the agent started  |
| `miroir_node_abandoned_freezes`     | snapshot-barrier `FIFREEZE` ioctls miroir stopped waiting for at their deadline and the kernel has not yet completed              |

A sustained non-zero `miroir_node_stranded_children` is the earliest
signal that a node's storage stack is jamming: it climbs while the
per-volume gauges still look healthy, because the stuck tasks hold
kernel locks that commands against healthy volumes then block on.
At the breaker's limit `miroir_node_wedged` goes to 1 and the agent
fails further `lvm`/`zfs`/`drbdsetup` calls and unmounts on that
node with `node storage stack wedged: node reboot required`.

Refusing is not a recovery — nothing in userspace can reap a task
the kernel holds. It bounds the pile so the node stays drainable:
unbounded, every retry (including kubelet's `NodeUnstageVolume`
retries) adds a stuck task until kubelet's own shutdown cannot
complete and the node needs an out-of-band power cycle. The shipped
`MiroirNodeStorageWedged` rule alerts on it; drain and reboot that
node. The gauge clears by itself if the stuck commands drain. Note
that the count lives in the agent process, so restarting the agent
resets it — the stuck tasks remain and the breaker re-trips once
enough new children strand.

The breaker also opens on a fatal DRBD kernel assertion in the node's
kernel log (a `put_ldev` refcount underflow, LINBIT/drbd#137): the
damaged refcount makes the next detach a hang or a use-after-free, so
the agent stops initiating DRBD state changes on the node. Unlike the
stranded-children trip, this latch never clears on its own and
survives agent restarts — the agent replays the kernel ring on start —
so `miroir_node_wedged` holds 1 until the node reboots. Unmounts are
not refused on a latch: the filesystem layer still works, and draining
the node is exactly the remedy.

A host command that outruns its deadline is killed, but a task in
uninterruptible sleep never receives the signal, and waiting on it
would block the caller for as long as the kernel holds it. miroir
stops waiting after a short grace, counts the child in
`miroir_node_stranded_children`, and fails the command with
`command abandoned in uninterruptible sleep: node reboot required`.
Teardowns park on that rather than retrying, because a retry only
strands another task.

`miroir_node_abandoned_freezes` is the same bound applied to snapshot
barriers. `FIFREEZE` cannot be interrupted at all, so an abandoned
freeze holds a goroutine — and the OS thread under it — until the
device finishes its writeback. The count drains by itself as the
ioctls return; while it sits at the cap, barriers on that node are
refused instead of adding more. Sustained non-zero means a backing
device cannot quiesce under its write load, and the shipped
`MiroirNodeFreezeBacklog` rule alerts on it.

One signal is not a `miroir_*` series at all. `MiroirAgentReconcileStalled`
watches controller-runtime's own
`workqueue_longest_running_processor_seconds`: a single reconcile that
has held its worker for more than 15 minutes. That object is making no
progress and the controller has one fewer worker for everything else —
and crucially it reports _nothing_, no Event, no status write, no log
line, because a reconcile that never returns never reaches a reporting
path. Every per-volume gauge keeps its last value and ages silently.
This queue-level view is the only one that sees it. Restarting the pod
frees the worker; whether the underlying task drains is a separate
question the node-scoped gauges above answer.

For RWX volumes the **controller** exports `miroir_export_ready`: 1
while the volume's NFS gateway is serving (gateway pod available,
export address published). This is the signal the per-volume gauges
cannot give you: DRBD replicas stay healthy while a dead gateway
leaves every NFS client hanging.

Each **gateway** pod additionally serves its own metrics endpoint
(scraped by a second PodMonitor, with `node` and `volume` labels):
`miroir_gateway_nfs_healthy` is the result of the last liveness
probe's NFS NULL call against the pod's local ganesha. The same
probe backs the pod's `/healthz`, so a ganesha that still accepts
TCP connections but has stopped answering NFS fails liveness and is
restarted. Previously that failure mode was invisible.

Prometheus is not the only surface. Volume health also flows through
the CSI `VolumeCondition`: enable `sidecars.healthMonitor.enabled`
and split-brain, failed-disk, and degraded volumes surface as events
on their PVCs (`kubectl describe pvc`).

## Starter alerts and dashboard

`monitoring.prometheusRule.enabled: true` ships starter alerts for
all of the above (split-brain, quorum lost, stranded barrier, disk
failed, a wedged teardown, degraded replication, sustained
out-of-sync, an unavailable RWX export, a stale verify schedule,
pool and thin-metadata usage, a stalled reconcile, a filesystem-freeze
backlog, and a down agent). A node whose agent
stops answering scrapes loses every `miroir_*` series, so none of
its per-volume alerts can fire; the kernel-floor refusal to start
looks exactly like this.
`monitoring.dashboards.enabled: true` installs a Grafana
dashboard, either a sidecar-labelled ConfigMap or a grafana-operator
`GrafanaDashboard` CR via `monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator`.

The per-volume alerts inherit the `pool` label and name the pool in
their summaries, so Alertmanager routes and silences can target a
single pool. The wedged-teardown alert is the exception: a pool can
be unknowable mid-teardown, so its metric carries only `volume`.
The dashboard's `pool` variable defaults to **All**; narrowing it
filters the volume-health and pool panels together.
